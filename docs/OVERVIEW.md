# Overview

This pre-sales initiative demonstrates how **Grafana** can visualize **Datto DRaaS/BCDR** health and trends using a simple, secure collector and redacted configuration. The goal is to help stakeholders see value quickly without exposing any sensitive details.

## Objectives
- Show key backup/restore KPIs at a glance.
- Provide a repeatable approach that can be adapted to the customer's tenant (outside this repo).
- Keep credentials out of source control and out of the demo environment.

## Outcomes
- A working dashboard (placeholder) that visualizes mock or real metrics.
- A runbook that enables smooth demo delivery.
- Documentation suitable for handover.
